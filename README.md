# Difference between document and window object

### What are Document and Window Objects?

**Document Object:
        It represents the web page loaded in the browser window. It serves as an entry point to the content of the web page and provides methods and properties to manipulate the content, such as modifying elements, accessing the DOM tree, and handling events related to the document.

**Window Object:
        It represents the browser window that contains the Document object. It acts as a global object for JavaScript code running within the browser window, providing access to various browser-related functionalities, such as navigating to URLs, opening new windows, setting timeouts, and handling events related to the window itself.
